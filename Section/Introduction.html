        <!-- Talk about my experiences -->
        <p>
            I graduated in Computation Engineering in Brazil at University Sao Judas Tadeu
            in Sao Paulo. Started in 2012 and ended in 2018, was a awesome route from the start to the end,
            in 2014 I was classified with my team to the Brazilian finals in ICPC (International College 
            Programming Contest) which with a great teamwork we reach the top 50 in Brazilian finals.
            and in 2018 I participated in a startup event (startup weekend) organized by the group ZeroOnze
            which with my team we were able to reach the 1st place on this event.
        </p>
        <p>
            My developer career started in 2014 as a fullstack developer in a small company
            called Netfashion, this company have a great environment and where I could learn alot
            about E-Commerce and ERP integrations which I got a very rich experience with differents
            companies and business models the main clients were from textile industry for B2B and B2C
            but there were also companies related with gift articles, helmet motocycle manufactoring, bags,
            camping & hunting and the oddly one the buy and sell natural hair.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2018 I started to search for new challenges where I got an opportunity in a medium company called
            GTI Solution a software factory which the main business model were insurance and CRM in this company 
            my main role was as backend developer which I had a strong contact with database, stored procedures, 
            APIs, source code versioning and agile methodology (Kanban). The best part was the team, we constantly 
            share knowledge and experiences which I'm grateful to learned about good practices and improve my team work.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2020 the challenge found me I got a contact with a recruiter from a startup company in machine learning
            business with a multicultural environment so english is mandatory, the company name is DefinedCrowd.
            This is the biggest challenge which I faced until this moment, I moved to a new amazing country during the 
            Covid-19 pandemic's lockdown. I came alone to acknoledge the environment and actually I fall in love this 
            place. In this company I learned about troubleshooting and monitoring, I work in the Tech Support Team 
            (Support lv3), which I got differents challenges everyday.
