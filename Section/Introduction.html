        <p>
            My name is Ricardo, and I'm a Brazilian natural from Sao Paulo - SP. 
            My parents are from Korea which they fled to South America after WWII. 
            Nowadays I'm living in Porto, Porto, Portugal. I have a spouse and dogs.

        <!-- Talk about my experiences -->
        <p>
            I graduated in Computation Engineering in Brazil at University Sao Judas Tadeu in Sao Paulo. 
            Started in 2012 and ended in 2018, was an awesome route from the start to the end, in 2014 
            I was classified with my team to the Brazilian finals in ICPC (International College 
            Programming Contest) which with great teamwork we reach the top 50 in Brazilian finals. 
            and in 2018 I participated in a startup event (startup weekend) organized by the group 
            ZeroOnze which with my team we were able to reach 1st place on this event.
        </p>

            My developer career started in 2014 as a full stack developer in a small company called 
            Netfashion, this company have a great environment and where I could learn a lot about 
            E-Commerce and ERP integrations which I got a very rich experience with different companies 
            and business models the main clients were from textile industry for B2B and B2C but there 
            were also companies related with gift articles, helmet motorcycle manufacturing, bags, 
            camping & hunting and the oddly one the buy and sell natural hair.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2018 I started to search for new challenges where I got an opportunity in a medium company 
            called GTI Solution a software factory whose main business model was insurance and CRM in the 
            company my main role was as backend developer which I had a strong contact with database, 
            stored procedures, APIs, source code versioning and agile methodology (Kanban). The best part 
            was the team, we constantly share knowledge and experiences which I'm grateful to learn about 
            good practices and improve my teamwork.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2020 the challenge found me I got contact with a recruiter from a startup company in 
            machine learning business with a multicultural environment so English is mandatory, the 
            company name is DefinedCrowd. This is the biggest challenge that I faced until this moment, 
            I moved to a new amazing country during the Covid-19 pandemic's lockdown. I came alone to 
            acknowledge the environment and I fall in love with this place. In this company I learned 
            about troubleshooting and monitoring, I work in the Tech Support Team (Support lv3), which 
            I got different challenges every day.
