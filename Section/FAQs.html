            <ul>
                <li>
                    My motivations are related with algorithms, when I was in college
                    my first motivation was the International College Programming Contest (ICPC)
                    and was in that momment I realized there is so many differents algorithms solutions
                    regarding the efficiency and performing Big-O analyses and finally I figure out.
                    This is what I want to do until the end
                    of life.

                    working only with myself to build this page I follow the Kanban framework.
