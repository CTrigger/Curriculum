                What is it your main motivations?
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        My motivations are related with algorithms, when I was in college 
                        my first motivation was the International College Programming Contest (ICPC) 
                        and was in that momment I realized there is so many differents algorithms solutions 
                        regarding the efficiency and performing Big-O analyses and finally I figure out. 
                        This is what I want to do until the end 
                        of life.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This is called Agile... I can't build this entire page with all features which I 
                        planned in 5 minutes, so I working to myself with partial delivering.    
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Assuming you also going to ask if I following some agile methodology, once I 
                        working only with myself to build this page I follow the Kanban framework.
                    </li>

                        Yes, Jenkins and Git.
