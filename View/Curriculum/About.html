        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a .NET Developer with experience with E-Commerce (4 years) and 
            Insurance systems (2 years).

        <p>
            The beginning of this journey started with maintenance in legacy systems 
            based on ASP2.0, and to implement for more modern technologies such as 
            C# .NET applications in MVC, acting as an integrator developing pluggins 
            and customizations for NopCommerce as a Fullstack, some time later a new 
            challenge in the insurance area as a developer backend developing new 
            features through API, stored procedures.
